            "We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n",
            "\n",
            "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",
            "\n",
            "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",

            "We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n",
            "\n",
            "And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n",
            "\n",
            "Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n",
            "\n",
            "If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n",

            "\n",
            "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",

            "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",

            "\n",
            "We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n",

The NATO Alliance was created to prevent chaos and aggression from dictators by providing a united front for defense. The support provided by NATO countries, including the United States, is crucial in helping Ukraine fight for freedom and defend its territory. By joining NATO, Ukraine can receive military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to ease its suffering and defend its country. The involvement of NATO in supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression shows the importance of collective security and diplomacy in maintaining peace and stability in Europe. Putin's attack on Ukraine was seen as premeditated and unprovoked, leading to a unified response from NATO to defend against further aggression. The United States and its allies, including NATO members, are committed to defending every inch of territory of NATO countries, including those under threat from Russian aggression. The support and assistance provided by NATO to Ukraine demonstrate the value of the alliance in promoting security and deterrence against aggression in the region.\""
